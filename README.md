Titanic Survival Prediction
Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Based on the famous Titanic dataset, the model analyzes passenger data such as age, sex, class, and other features to estimate the probability of survival.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including:

    PassengerId

    Pclass (Ticket class)

    Name

    Sex

    Age

    SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)

    Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)

    Ticket

    Fare

    Cabin

    Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

    Survived (Target variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Objective

    To build a predictive model that can classify whether a passenger survived or not based on their features.

    To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Methodology

    Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding relationships between variables and survival rates.

    Model Training: Applying machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or others.

    Evaluation: Validating the model on a test set and measuring performance metrics.

    Prediction: Using the model to predict survival outcomes for new data.

Technologies Used

    Python

    Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)

    Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)

    Scikit-learn (Machine learning)

    Jupyter Notebook
